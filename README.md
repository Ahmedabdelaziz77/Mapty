# Mapty Project

This project is a web application developed as part of the Mapty project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course. 
It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive map where users can track their running or cycling journeys.

## Demo

## Features

- Interactive map interface powered by Leaflet.js.
- Allows users to add running or cycling journeys by clicking on the map.
- Users can input journey details such as distance, duration, cadence, and elevation gain through a form.
- Markers are displayed on the map for each journey, showing details in a pop-up when clicked.
- Utilizes localStorage to persist journey data locally in the browser.


## What I Learned

Throughout this course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- Understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript.
- Implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript to create modular and reusable code.
- Utilizing the Leaflet.js library to create interactive maps.
- Working with localStorage for data persistence in web applications.
- Enhancing my problem-solving abilities through project-based learning.
